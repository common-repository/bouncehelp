Increase Sales Calls up to 30%. Bouncehelp delivers website engagement tools that guarantee increased phone calls from your website traffic, quickly connecting visitors, otherwise lost, with your business.

Engage Visitors During Session
Visitor tracking and engagement is first initiated by a stylish scrolling contact button on the bottom right corner of your website. Offering an easy way to initiate contact with you, the contact button, once clicked opens a slide out panel. The slide out panel is also activated, on certain visitor behaviours, prompting a call to action to connect with you. Asking your website visitor to input their phone number of choice.  Once a quick connect call is activated a countdown timer is displayed, reassuring your customer that they will be helped in under 8 seconds. Invite your visitors to call you, and get more sales calls.

Engage Visitors When They Leave
97% of visitors tend to leave your website without making the desired action, so it’s a good idea to try to catch them at that time. Bouncehelp monitors visitors behavior, once an exit intent has been triggered, Exit Monitor displays a targeted offer or a question to your visitor. Engaging your visitor, Bouncehelp invites him or her to get a call from a company within 8 seconds. Engaging and converting abandoning website visitors into leads, that could have bought from your competition, increases profits, and is just “Smart Business”. 

Engage Visitors on Mobile
With over 50% of searches being mobile, Mobile Connect is a simple way for your website visitors to contact your business while on the go. With just one tap your visitors will be on the phone with your sales representative. A simple, stylish and engaging button that is always available on any website is an powerful solution for your customers to reach you when they need you the most.
